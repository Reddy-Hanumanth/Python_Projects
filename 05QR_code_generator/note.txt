we are using virtual environment 
   *  A virtual environment (venv) is an isolated workspace for a Python project.
   *  When you activate a virtual environment and install packages (pip install xyz), those packages are installed only inside that environment, not globally.
   *  Important clarification (common confusion):
   *  When you deactivate the virtual environment:
   *  The installed packages do NOT disappear or get deleted
   *  They are simply not accessible until you activate that environment again

activate => venv\Scripts\activate
Deactivate => deactivate
